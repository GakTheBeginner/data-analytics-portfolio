# Data Analytics Portfolio(Google Data Analytics Capstone - 1)

Introduction
This will guide you through how I tackled Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate case study: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis. This project will be conducted in order to gain some insights into the trends, behaviour, and characteristics of rides and riders, which would lead to the answers to the key business questions. For this project, I have followed the 6 data anlysis process; Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, share, and act.

Background:
I am a junior data analyst at a fictional company. The company launched a successful bike-share offering in 2016. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. The company has the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are its members.
The company's finance analysts concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

Business Task:
The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Business objectives:
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Tools:
MySQL for data processing, data cleaning, validation, and exploration
Tableau Public for data visualization

Dataset:
The company's histrical data has been used for this project.
